# App Name
App Name is a thought-sharing app that sparks interesting conversations with your closest friends. At my previous startup, my co-founder and I built, from scratch, a creator network of over a billion followers. We lived in the LA Hype House, hosting Lil Nas X’s birthday party and events that celebrities like David Dobrik, Madison Beer, Addison Rae, and many more have attended. 

I grew sick and tired of the industry and wanted to build something a lot more true and genuine. By focusing on being the layer between private messaging apps and global social networks, each feature was designed to take advantage of the local scale of the app that wouldn’t be possible on a global network. Some examples include: 50 friend limit, each post opens up to a group chat instead of a comment section, face reactions instead of likes, posts can only be sent to friends or friends of friends, and ability to invite specific friends directly to the chat.

Launched this to a group of ~40 users for about a month with ~15 DAU and 4-5 active posters before I shut it down.
